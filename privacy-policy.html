    <h1>Privacy Policy for Decision Dating App</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Last updated:</strong> <span class="date">April 21, 2025</span>
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected,
      used, and shared when you use our Decision Dating application ("App").
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our App collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Audio Recordings:</strong> When you press the record button, we
        temporarily collect the audio of your speech for the purpose of
        transcription.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device Permissions:</strong> We request microphone access to
        enable audio recording functionality.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Transcription Services:</strong> Your audio recordings are
        processed locally on iOS devices using the device's built-in speech
        recognition when available. In cases where native speech recognition is
        unavailable or fails, audio may be sent to OpenAI's servers for
        transcription processing via their Whisper API.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Providing App Functionality:</strong> To convert your speech to
        text within the App.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We share your information as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>OpenAI:</strong> When native speech recognition is unavailable
        or fails, your audio recordings may be sent to OpenAI for processing
        through their Whisper API. OpenAI's use of this data is governed by
        their
        <a href="https://openai.com/privacy/" target="_blank">privacy policy</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Apple:</strong> When using iOS devices, your speech may be
        processed using Apple's on-device speech recognition technology. This
        processing happens locally on your device and audio data is not sent to
        Apple's servers unless you have enabled "Improve Siri & Dictation" in
        your iOS settings.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with any other
      third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Audio Recordings:</strong> Audio recordings are not stored on
        our servers. They are temporarily processed and then discarded
        immediately after transcription.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Transcribed Text:</strong> Transcribed text remains solely on
        your device and is not stored on our servers.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your
      personal information, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to access information we have about you</li>
      <li>The right to request deletion of your data</li>
      <li>The right to object to processing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our App uses OpenAI's Whisper API for speech-to-text processing. Their
      privacy practices are governed by their own privacy policy, which we
      encourage you to review.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in
      our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We
      will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this
      page.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
